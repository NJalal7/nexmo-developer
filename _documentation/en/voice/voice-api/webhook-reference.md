# Voice API Webhooks Reference

Nexmo uses webhooks alongside its Voice API to enable your application to interact with the call. There are two required, and one optional, webhook endpoints:

* [Answer webhook](#answer-webhook) is sent when a call is answered. This is for both incoming and outgoing calls.
* [Event webhook](#event-webhook) is sent for all the events that occur during a call. Your application can log, react to or ignore each event type.
* [Fallback Answer URL](#fallback-answer-url) is used when either the Answer or Event webhook fails or returns an HTTP error status. 
* [Errors](#errors) are also delivered to the event webhook endpoint if they occur.

For more general information, check out our [webhooks guide](/concepts/guides/webhooks).

## Answer Webhook

When an incoming call is answered, an HTTP request is sent to the `answer_url` you specified when setting up the application. For outgoing calls, specify the `answer_url` when you make the call.

By default, the answer webhook will be a `GET` request but this can be overridden to `POST` by setting the `answer_method` field. For incoming calls, you configure these values when you create the application. For outgoing calls, you specify these values when making a call.

### Answer webhook data fields

Field | Example | Description 
 -- | -- | --
`to` | `442079460000` | The number the call came from (this could be your Nexmo number if the call is started programmatically)
`from` | `447700900000` | The call the number is to (this could be a Nexmo number or another phone number)
`uuid` | `aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab` | A unique identifier for this call
`conversation_uuid` | `CON-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab` | A unique identifier for this conversation

#### Transmitting additional data with SIP headers

In addition to the above fields, you can specify any additional headers you need when using SIP Connect. Any headers provided must start with `X-` and will be sent to your `answer_url` with a prefix of `SipHeader_`. For example, if you add a header of `X-UserId` with a value of `1938ND9`, Nexmo will add `SipHeader_X-UserId=1938ND9` to the request made to your `answer_url`.

> **Warning:** Headers that start with `X-Nexmo` will not be sent to your `answer_url`

### Answer webhook data field examples

For a `GET` request, the variables will be in the URL, like this:

```
/answer.php?to=442079460000&from=447700900000&conversation_uuid=CON-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab&uuid=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab&SipHeader_X-UserId=1938ND9
```

If you set the `answer_method` to `POST` then you will receive the request with JSON format data in the body:

```
{
  "from": "442079460000",
  "to": "447700900000",
  "uuid": "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab",
  "conversation_uuid": "CON-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab",
  "SipHeader_X-UserId": "1938ND9"
}
```

### Responding to the answer webhook

Nexmo expect you to return an [NCCO](/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference) in JSON format containing the actions to perform.

## Event webhook

HTTP requests will arrive at the event webhook endpoint when there is any status change for a call. The URL will be the `event_url` you specified when creating your application unless you override it by setting a specific `event_url` when starting a call.

By default the incoming requests are `POST` requests with a JSON body. You can override the method to `GET` by configuring the `event_method` in addition to the `event_url`.

The format of the data included depends on which event has occurred:

* [`started`](#started)
* [`ringing`](#ringing)
* [`answered`](#answered)
* [`busy`](#busy)
* [`cancelled`](#cancelled)
* [`unanswered`](#unanswered)
* [`rejected`](#rejected)
* [`failed`](#failed)
* [`human/machine`](#human-machine)
* [`timeout`](#timeout)
* [`completed`](#completed)
* [`record`](#record)
* [`input`](#input)
* [`transfer`](#transfer)

### Transfer

This webhook is sent by Nexmo when a leg has been transferred from one conversation to another. This can be done using an NCCO or the [`transfer` action](/api/voice#updateCall)

Field | Example | Description

## Fallback Answer URL

The fallback answer webhook is accessed when either the answer webhook or the event webhook, when the event is expected to respond with an NCCO, returns an HTTP error status or is unreachable. The data that is returned from the fallback answer URL is the same as would be received in the original answer URL or event URL.

If there was a connection closed or reset, timeout or an HTTP status code of `429`, `503` or `504` during the initial NCCO the `answer_url` is attempted twice, then:

1. Go to `fallback_answer_url`
2. Attempt to reach the fallback URL twice
3. If no success, then the call is terminated

If there was a connection closed or reset, timeout or an HTTP status code of `429`, `503` or `504` during a call in progress the `event_url` for events that are expected to return an NCCO (e.g. return for an `input` or `notify` action) is attempted twice, then:

1. Go to `fallback_answer_url`
2. Attempt to reach the fallback URL twice
3. If no success, continue the call flow

## Errors

The event endpoint will also receive webhooks in the event of an error. This can be useful when debugging your application.

Field | Example | Description
 -- | -- | --
`reason` | `Syntax error in NCCO. Invalid value type or action.` | Information about the nature of the error
`conversation_uuid` | `CON-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab` | The unique identifier for this conversation
`timestamp` | `2020-01-01T12:00:00.000Z` | Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
